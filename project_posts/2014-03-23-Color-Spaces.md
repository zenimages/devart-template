The more pictures I took, the more I learned about the color. Then I've bought a wide-gamut monitor, and then, being puzzled by the acid greens and reds, a colorimeter. That's how I've introduced myself to the [color spaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_space).

Being a Linux adept for years, I started to play with [Argyll Color Management System](http://www.argyllcms.com/) and its [dispcalGUI](http://dispcalgui.hoech.net/) assistant. It had so many settings, so it puzzled me lot!

With the means of [iccgamut](http://argyllcms.com/doc/iccgamut.html) I've been creating VRML files for ICC profiles of my monitor and the cameras and standard color spaces like sRGB and played with them in [MeshLab](http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/). 

That's how I've learned that my monitor is capable of displaying a much lager amount of colors than it can be encoded in HDTV signal (except, probably, for some yellowish hues):

And that's how I've discovered that Canon 7D can capture an incredibly larger amount of colors than my monitor can display (except for some bluish):

From the article [Optics of Digital Cinema](https://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs781/PinhoDigitalCinemaTalk.pdf) I've learned, that cinema DLP projectors are not capable of displaying deep green colors, those inherent to film projectors. What was more disappointing is that digital cinema standard (DCIâ€“P3) doesn't even cover 90% of the real world colors, which are described by [Pointer's research](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/col.5080050308/abstract).

I've also tested web browsers and figured out that Google Chrome doesn't support color management, while Mozilla Firefox does the job well.

At this point I was pretty fed by the technical details (so is the reader), and six months later, at the end of February 2014, _it_ happened.
