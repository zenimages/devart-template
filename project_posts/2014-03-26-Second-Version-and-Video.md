I've manually checked all the colors, that produce meaningful results. As you'll see in a video, many of them are clothing like shoes or denim, because TCX swatches are especially designed for cotton. Some are the clear mixture of two types - photographs and drawings, like maps, and I didn't include them so far (I will have to do some smart filtering). Other results are polysemantic (instead of putty - type of material - it finds [PyTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) - a popular SSH client), so this could itself give a new angle of view on a semantic search topic for Google and I'd like to do a further research in this area.

So, more than 500 screenshots are made in a full screen mode and tied together with [OpenShot](http://www.openshot.org/):

In the second version of script I've added ability just to switch a background color (with a right click on a color). It's useful when you need to compare two colors or to match the color name for some object not in the list, but it looks like so far that the first version is enough for the prototype.

The initial plan was to leverage [Custom Search API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview), but the manual search with the script turned out to be more effective. Moreover, API provides only 100 free searches per day and it wasn't enough for the prototype. But if I'm successful to win, Custom Search API will be used to produce the installation in the Barbican Center, since the results filtering is be absolutely necessary and have to be discusses later with Judges.
