While the idea to create ZenImages came during DevArt contest dates, I didn't initially think about the installation. It should be possible to enjoy ZenImages even at home. But the exhibition in an art center is a completely another opportunity for a visitor and hence requires special attention.

This is exactly where the color spaces and other technical aspects of color and physical aspects of light should be carefully treated. It is possible to create special viewing conditions, that give unique user experience, that cannot be simply reproduced at home by everyone.

I see the installation as minimalistic as the prototype:

![Installation](../project_images/installation.jpeg?raw=true)

The main part is an LCD panel, mounted on the wall with the center point a bit under the line of eyes of an average man. It is *absolutely necessary that the panel is wide-gamut*, covering at least 95% of [AdobeRGB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_RGB_color_space). Depending on what will be available in stock, the panel could be 30"-40" (the bigger, the better). It should be calibrated so that all colors look pure and attractive.

At some distance from the wall, there is a control panel or touch pad. The distance depends on size of the panel and allows a convinient and comfortable angle of view (20°-30°).

The screen and touch pad are connected and controlled from a desktop or laptop PC behind the wall (not shown). 

Two lamps on the ceiling (not shown) are professional lighting systems for creating a soft ambient light with a color temperature, close to the daylight. Spotlights and harsh sunlight from windows should be carefully avoided.

The colors are changed in a looped manner, like a screensaver. When somebody touches the pad, ZenImages pauses and goes into interactive mode so that the visitor can choose an arbitrary color or scroll down search results for more images. After some time of inactivity, the screensaver mode returns back.

So that's it.
