It all has started when I'd entered digital photography's world as my hobby. I've read some books, including the most notable one in this subject, _Professional Photoshop: The Classic Guide to Color Correction_ by Dan Margulis. I've learned that making good photos is not about digital technology at all, so I've stepped back into the history to the birth of photography, and that's how I've meet _Pictorial Composition In Photography_ by Arthur Hammond (1920), which is available in [public domain](https://archive.org/details/pictorialcomposi005829mbp)). The book was full of black-and-white pictures, but they all was so charming, so I was inspired to start making my own ones, however in color and with a digital camera.

Hammond was referring another author of that time, Ernest Govett, who did a research on art “with special reference to painting”. His book, _Art Principles_ (1919), is also available in [public domain](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/36427/36427-h/36427-h.htm). The definition of art, placed as an epigraph to the Project, is taken from that book:

_“An art is the beautiful representation of nature for the purpose of giving disinterested pleasure”_.

And since we tend to apply a knowledge to our profession, I has applied it to software development, where I has been for more that 13 years. From that phrase the idea of creating a software as an art has come into my mind.
